Specifies the Label of the Snapshot to generate. It must be unique for a given Application in a given Dashboard Service.
The tag [TODAY] can be used (replaced by today's date at runtime) or a date with the following format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss".
Any tag available in the Jenkins Environment variables can also be used. They need to be between brackets. (examples: [BUILD_TAG], [BUILD_NUMBER], [BUILD_ID], [JOB_NAME],...)
